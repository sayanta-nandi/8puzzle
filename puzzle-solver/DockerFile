# Stage 1: Build the application using Gradle Wrapper
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk AS builder

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only Gradle wrapper and build config files first (for caching)
COPY puzzle-solver/gradlew puzzle-solver/gradlew.bat puzzle-solver/settings.gradle puzzle-solver/build.gradle /app/

# Copy Gradle wrapper folder (for bootstrapping Gradle)
COPY puzzle-solver/gradle /app/gradle

# Run a dummy build to cache dependencies (optional, speeds up future builds)
RUN ./gradlew build -x test --no-daemon || true

# Copy the rest of the source files
COPY puzzle-solver/src /app/src

# Now do the actual build
RUN ./gradlew build -x test --no-daemon

# Stage 2: Create a lightweight image to run the app
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre

# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built jar from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build/libs/*.jar app.jar

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the app
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
